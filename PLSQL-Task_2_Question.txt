If a single coach of metro is having

2+2 = 4 senior citizen
7+7 = 14, in 14, 2 sen citizen, 2 ladies
7+7 = 14, in 14, 2 sen citizen, 2 ladies
7+7 = 14, in 14, 2 sen citizen, 2 ladies
2+2 = 4 senior citizen
,
Over all single coach is having 50 seats, divided as above given,
 
So create a function in which 
No of coach is input parameter
and
No of seats for sen citizen,
No of seats for ladies,
No of seats for normal passengers,
No of over all seats
 
will be the output of that function.
