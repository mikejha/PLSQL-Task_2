If a single coach of metro is having

7+7 = 14, in 14, 2 sen citizen, 2 ladies
7+7 = 14, in 14, 2 sen citizen, 2 ladies
7+7 = 14, in 14, 2 sen citizen, 2 ladies
2+2 = 4 senior citizen
,
Over all single coach is having 50 seats, divided as above given,
 
So create a function in which coach is input parameter
and
No of seats for sen citizen.
No of seats for ladies.
No of seats for normal passengers.
No of over all seats.
 
Will be the output of that function.
